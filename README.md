Software Overview:

This software is designed for direct phasing of protein crystals, enabling the reconstruction of protein electron density directly from protein crystal diffraction data. It is referenced in the paper titled "Enhanced Direct Method in Protein Crystallography Using Parallel Genetic Algorithm," authored by Ruijiang Fu, Wu-Pei Su, and Hongxing He.

(1) Software Requirements: To compile and run the code, you will need the Intel C++ Compiler, MPI Library, and Math Kernel Library, all bundled within the Intel oneAPI HPC Toolkit.

(2) Download and Installation Instructions: You can procure and install the Intel oneAPI HPC Toolkit via this link: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/hpc-toolkit-download.html By navigating to this page, you will discover options to download the toolkit compatible with your operating system. Follow the outlined instructions to finalize the installation. Upon installation, you will gain access to the Intel C++ Compiler, MPI Library, and Math Kernel Library necessary for compiling and executing your code.

(3) Compilation and Execution Instructions: It is crucial to note that the number of processes utilized by mpirun should not surpass the total number of cores (or threads) on your CPU, as exceeding this limit may significantly hinder performance. Assuming a computing node with 50 cores (100 threads), we recommend using 100 processes for mpirun. GA-enhannced direct phasing benifits from more parallel processes. To compile and execute the code, simply follow these commands:

mpirun -np 100 ./a.out

(4) Preparing Input Files (Illustrated with Example 1no4): When the PDB structure is known, and you aim to validate the phasing method, the required input files are: 1no4_fmodel.hkl,.HKL,.sca 1no4_uniq_sf.txt 1no4_iter_sigm.txt 1rb6_hist.txt crysPara.hpp

A. Download the atomic model 1no4.pdb from www.rcsb.org, and run phenix.fmodel to generate 1no4_fmodel.hkl,.HKL,.mtz for assessing phase angle deviations in direct phasing:

phenix.fmodel 1no4.pdb k_sol=0.336 b_sol=50 high_res=1.52 scattering_table=wk1995 data_column_label="FMODEL,PHIFMODEL" output.file_name=1no4_fmodel.hkl,.HKL,.mtz > log.phenix.fmodel.txt;

B. Download 1no4-sf.cif from www.rcsb.org, extract _refln.F_meas_au and _refln.F_meas_sigma_au, and sort reflections by resolution to obtain 1no4_uniq_sf.txt.

C. Refer to the paper "Improving the convergence rate of a hybrid input-output phasing algorithm by varying the reflection data weight" by He, H.; Su, W.-P. (Acta Cryst. A 2018, 74, 36â€“43. http://doi.org/10.1107/S205327331701436X) to generate 1no4_iter_sigm.txt.

D. To modify the reconstructed electron density for histogram matching, select a protein (e.g., 6g6e) with similar resolution, average temperature factor, and secondary structure. Obtain the protein histogram for 6g6e to generate 6g6e_hist.txt.

E. Set crystal parameters including a, b, c, alpha, beta, gamma, space group, cutoff resolution, estimated solvent content, and direct phasing parameters such as sigma for the weighted average density used in reconstructing the protein contour.

When the protein structure is unknown, to perform direct phasing of the crystal, the necessary input files include: 1no4_uniq_sf.txt, 1no4_iter_sigm.txt, 1rb6_hist.txt, and crysPara.hpp.

As direct phasing parameters, such as solvent content and reference histogram settings, may need to be adjusted and tested for different crystal structures, which requires a certain level of experience, we strongly recommend sending your experimental data to hehongxing@nbu.edu.cn. We will endeavor to adjust the parameters and solve for the phases on your behalf. Please be assured that your experimental data will not be disclosed without your explicit permission.
